Champaign Public Library, in the Robeson Pavillion Room C at 6:30 PM

Agenda:

* Birds of a Feather breakout sessions.

### Main Talk

Robin Berthier, a Faculty Researcher at the University of Illinois, will be
talking about the University Compromised Account Asssesment System (UCAAS), which he
helped build. UCAAS was programmend in python, calling into the Weka machine
learning tool. The frontend for the system is based on Django. More about UCAAS:

>The University Compromised Account Assessment System (UCAAS) has been built to
>detect and report potentially compromised accounts. This system was developed
>and evaluated through collaboration between researchers and security analysts
>at the University of Illinois, the University of Michigan, and BBN Technology.

### Breakout Sessions

We will break out into various sessions, based on interests of the people present.
There have been a few suggested ideas, like:

* Putting together a regular "hack day"
* Web Scraping
* Python in security

But any topics are on the table!

### Finally....

We would appreciate if you take some time to fill out this survey
if you plan on coming to this, or any, event of ours, so we can use
the info to find topics and presenters that are actually of interest
to the community in C-U. We will not use this information for
anything other than understanding the group, ever.
