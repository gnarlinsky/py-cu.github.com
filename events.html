          <p>Our first meeting will be held at the Champaign Public Library, in
          the Robeson Pavillion Room C at 6:30 PM

          <ul> Agenda:
            <li> Opening - what is Py-CU?</li>
            <li> Lightning Talks - 6:45 - 7:15</li>
            <li> Main Talk: Gabe Weaver - 7:15 - 7:30</li>
            <li> Birds of a Feather breakout sessions - 7:30 - whenever</li>
          </ul>

          <h3> Main Talk </h3>
          <p>Gabe Weaver will be talking about his XU-Tools project, it's motivations and
          implementation in python. He desribes XU-Tools as:
          <blockquote >Our eXtended Unix tools (XUTools)
            extend traditional Unix tools to process a broader class of
            languages in which security-policies are expressed.  XUTools is
            already in demand by a variety of practitioners and articles on our
            research have been featured in various news outlets such as
            ComputerWorld, CIO Magazine, Communications of the ACM, and Hacker
            News.
          </blockquote>
          <h3> Lightning Talks </h3>
          Lightning talks are short talks. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">
            More info</a>) They are generally introductions to a topic, or a rant, or a
          rave, or.... The talks are a maximum of 5 minutes and open to anyone, on a first-come first-serve
          basis. If you want to give a lightning talk, show up a bit early and get on the list!

          <h3>Birds of a Feather Breakouts </h3>
          After the "official" content, we'll be breaking out into
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)"> Birds of a Feather </a>
          sessions. The topics are fluid, but the idea is to find people with similar interests and
          hack, discuss, and generally have fun.

          <h3> And finally....</h3>

          <p>We would appreciate if you take some time to fill out this survey
          if you plan on coming to this, or any, event of ours, so we can use
          the info to find topics and presenters that are actually of interest
          to the community in C-U. We will not use this information for
          anything other than understanding the group, ever.
